By making this project, I explored the Unity game engine. I'm not an expert yet, but I had a lot of fun seeing my code come to life. I'm looking forward to creating more projects in Unity in the future.
Here are some things I learned through this project:
-created and managed GameObjects like the bird, pipes and UI elements;
-used Rigidbody2D and simple physics forces to simulate jumping and falling;
-implemented logic to end the game when the bird dies or falls below a certain Y position;
-displayed score and game over screen using the UI system and handled button interactions;
-used SceneManager to reload the game scene when the player presses "Play Again".
